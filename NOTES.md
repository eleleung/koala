* throw exception on UPDATE/DELETE with no where clause?
* SELECT optional for subUNION (provided by outer query)
* Support VALUES (how to bind value colums to fields?)
* Correlated subquery support
* backtick escape names and prevent auto-generated name collision
* do not attempt to represent NULLability as Kotlin optional. poor fit to SQL semantics
* shared subcase for different INT data types?
