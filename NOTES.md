Project consists of two parts - schema and query:

Schema definition and diff framework:

* Aims to faithfully represent schema
* Does not provide DDL directly
* Instead, DDL is figured out from diffs 

SQL query/statement dsl:

* Aims to faithfully represent SQL
* Should be clear what SQL is generated
* 1-1 correspondence between DSL queries and SQL
